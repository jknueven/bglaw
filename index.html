		                        Since 1854, we have helped companies and individuals solve their problems – in and out of the courtroom. Our approach to litigation is simple: We build relationships with our clients and seek efficient solutions to their problems.

		                        We conscientiously strive to avoid spending time and money on collateral and secondary disputes and issues. Instead, we focus on resolving the underlying disputes without creating side issues that generate legal fees and provide little or no benefit for our clients. Therefore, we subscribe to the admonition, "Never mistake motion for action." By understanding our clients' situations and focusing on practical solutions to their problems, we effectively advocate and protect their interests.

		                                        There are many alternatives to trial, and while the lawyers of Bieser Greer are experienced in the various forms of dispute resolution, we are advocates of only two of these forms: binding arbitration and mediation.

		                                        The choice between trial and arbitration, if such a choice is available, is dependent on the facts and issues presented by a given dispute. Mediation, however, when properly timed and undertaken, has proven effective in almost every matter and every substantive area that becomes the subject of litigation. Our attorneys have served as mediators, arbitrators, and on frequent occasions, as counsel for parties to such proceedings.

		                                    Individuals who work in the construction industry know that all of the contractors on a job need to work together to create a safe work environment while at the same time face the issues of contractual deadlines. When things do not work the way they should claims may arise for breaches of contract including delays and other issues. There may also be claims for personal injury, wrongful death or property damage as the result of the alleged conduct of a particular contractor. Bieser Greer has extensive knowledge and experience in construction litigation for those seeking counsel in these cases.

Government at all levels continues to expand the use of criminal remedies as a way to deter and punish disfavored conduct.

We competently and compassionately guide clients through all phases of workplace disputes – from prevention through litigation. We have extensive trial experience in state and federal courts relating to a wide-range of employment claims, including discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wrongful discharge, breach of contract, wage and hour disputes, FMLA and military leave entitlement, invasion of privacy, unfair labor practices, and intentional torts. In addition, we have handled a great number of cases involving the enforcement of non-compete agreements and claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. While our primary goal is to keep our clients out of court, if possible, we have earned a reputation for aggressive and effective representation in the courtroom.

Although dealing with taxes adds an important dimension to proper planning, the role of the attorney — to counsel with the client and to assist in developing a plan which best serves the client’s needs and wishes — has not changed.

		                                        We all deal with products every day. Sometimes while using or utilizing a product a consumer may sustain an injury or property damage may occur. Litigating with claims of a defective product takes both skill and experience. The investigative process into the cause of injury, death or property damage can be complicated. The attorneys of Bieser Greer are widely recognized as among the best around to handle these complex cases both on the side of the defendant manufacturer and on the side of the injured consumer. In fact, one of its partners has been recognized by Best Lawyers in America in this specialized field.
