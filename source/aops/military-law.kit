                         Those who have served in our armed forces understand that success is the product of dedication, devotion and teamwork. Bieser Greer puts those principles into practice in its representation of active duty, reserve and retired military members, as well as civilian defense contractors, in various civil, administrative and criminal situations. We recognize the unique obligations imposed by military service, and strive to achieve the best results for our individual clients while respecting the needs of our military forces.
