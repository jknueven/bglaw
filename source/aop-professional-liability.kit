                                 The experience of litigation can be especially stressful and frustrating to a professional person who feels disadvantaged by the prospect of sympathy for his or her adversary and distracted by the pressure of court proceedings on an already overloaded work schedule. Confidence in effective representation is essential to mitigating such stress and frustration and to achieving a successful resolution of the claims asserted.
