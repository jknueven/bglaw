                        The climate for business-government relations, especially for those businesses subject to government regulations, has become increasingly aggressive in both investigations and legal proceedings. At both the state and federal level, businesses and individuals face government regulations and enforcement actions. As a result, some civil and regulatory matters can result in criminal investigations.

                        This is a field in which early attorney involvement is highly desirable since governmental discretion tends to be broad at early stages of an investigation and narrow sharply as an investigation moves to and through the stages of indictment and trial preparation. The lawyer’s experience in the criminal justice system and in the courtroom is essential to the handling of a case where an individual’s career, life and liberty may be at stake.
