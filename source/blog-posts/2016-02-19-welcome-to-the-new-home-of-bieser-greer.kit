                                    You’ve probably noticed a few changes around here lately.

                                    We’ve worked hard over the past few months to create a new website as polished and professional as our firm. This site launch is a part of a larger effort to rebrand Bieser Greer, previously Bieser, Greer & Landis. We even have a new logo – one that better represents our firm’s strengths.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The goal of our rebranding initiative was to update our image in a way that reflects not only our deep and storied history, but our status as a contemporary law firm looking to the future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our firm may have a fresh, new look, but one thing that has stayed the same is our commitment to our customers through quality service – building relationships with our clients and seeking efficient solutions to their problems. We remain devoted to a tradition of exceptional service.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bieser Greer’s Dayton roots extend back more than 160 years. We’re happy to call the Gem City our home, and hope to continue to serve it for another century and a half – and beyond.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We encourage you to peruse our new website – we think you’ll find some great information about our breadth of <a href="/#aop">legal services</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the meantime, feel free to <a href="/#contactus">get in touch</a> and let us know how we can be of service. We look forward to hearing from you.
